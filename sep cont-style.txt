When writing in hypertext language, it is important to separate content
and style. Style should be kept tucked away in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

Semantic refers to the meaning of words in a language. Semantic tags said 
something about the semantic of the tag. It offered meaning. 
ex:
<em>	        Emphasizes text
<strong>	Important text

<b> vs <strong>

Bold is a style that makes letters thicker so it stands out among other
text but it has no semantic meaning, for example for voice browsers, 
screen readers, and other types of ways to access the Web. A device like
Kindle Paperwhite that renders text differently and might not pick 
up the bold.

Strong is an indication of how something should be. It looks like bold in
 a browser, but it could mean ‘speak with urgency or seriousness’ when 
reading text aloud. It is semantic in the sense, that we instruct it to 
be stronger than the text it surrounds which is different from giving 
instructions on how the text should look like in the case of <b>. 
It represents importance, seriousness, or urgency for its contents.

<i> vs <em>

Italics slants text. We usually italicize names of magazine, books, 
TV shows etc. Just like the bold tag, since it is meant purely for presentation
 purposes, it means nothing to someone who cannot read the text.

Emphasis is used to stress emphasis of its contents. The word in a sentence 
you emphasize can change the whole meaning.
