Attributes

Attributes are used in tags to further define the tag.
Attributes are a name-value pair: 
example:start="5"
name - start
value - any positive integer
if attribute is a 'boolean attribute'(value true or false),add the attribute name to
to indicate true and omit to indicate false.
ex: <ol reversed></ol>

tag can have multiple attributes:
ex:<ol start="5"></ol>
   <ol id="cinema" class="attribute-list" start="5"></ol>
   <ol start="5" class="attribute-list"></ol>


Global & non-global attributes

Global attributes can be applied to all tags. They are common attributes. 
Examples of global attributes are 'id' and 'class'.  
So attributes like 'id' and 'class' can be applied to any HTML tag.
<ul id="intro-list"></ul>
<pre class="html-code"></pre>

Non-global attributes are attributes applied to a specific instance 
of a tag. It can be applied to one or more tags. 
Like start is an attribute for the <ol> tag.
 start cannot be applied on the <p> or <h1> tags and is specific to
 only ordered lists - <ol>. 


'id' is primarily used for:

1.Styling your element. You can specify the style you want for the 
element in your style sheet by referencing the 'id'.
2.As a link target. You can link to a section of your HTML page 
using the 'id' of the section. 
3.In JavaScript, 'id' can be used to manipulate a html element. 

'class' is primarily used for:

1. Styling your elements. You can specify the style you want for all 
the elements that belong to the class in your stylesheet. 
2. In JavaScript, 'class' can also be used to manipulate html elements
 of the same class. 


GLOBAL ATTRIBUTE: 'LANG'

The 'lang' attribute indicates the language of the text in the element
 to which it is attached.  Identifying the language of content is 
increasingly important, as browsers adapt styling and other aspects 
of the user's experience according to the language of the content. 
ex:
<html lang="en-GB">...</html>
<p>In French you'd say <span lang="fr">On voit souvent des chats sur le Web.</span></p>

A message that appears when you point your cursor at something is 
called a tooltip
the title attribute is used to provide additional 
information about it. It is very useful to elaborate abbreviations 
or add some context. For images, you must use an alt attribute as 
there is no guarantee that the title attribute is presented to assistive
 technology users. The title can be of any text value. 
ex:<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>
